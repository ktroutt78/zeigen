# Decisions

Append-only log. Newest at top. Don't re-litigate settled decisions — if you want to revisit one, add a new entry that supersedes it.

## 2026-04-25 — Share link expiration: none

Links are permanent. Mockup proposed 30 days; rejected to keep behavior simple. No expiration UI, no cleanup job.

## 2026-04-25 — Custom domain: no

Use the default Cloudflare Pages subdomain (e.g., `zeigen-share.pages.dev`). Custom domain adds DNS, cert renewal, and an external dependency without proportional value for a personal tool.

## 2026-04-25 — Old `~/Movies/Dashcast/` recordings: leave in place

No auto-migration on first Zeigen launch. Folder is harmless. Move or delete manually if/when desired.

## 2026-04-25 — Public name: Zeigen (not a codename)

Treat as final. Titlebars, save paths, viewer UI, share URLs all use "Zeigen." Pronunciation: TSIGH-gen (German "to show").

## 2026-04-25 — Tauri bundle ID: com.zeigen.app

Renamed from `com.dashcast.app` while still in dev. No installed builds in the wild, so no migration needed.
